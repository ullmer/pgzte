pgzte
============

pgzte is a fork of Pygame Turbo, which is a more swiftly-evolving, pygame-ce 
compliant fork of Pygame Zero, the zero-boilerplate games programming framework.

pgzte is initially agnostic between Pygame Turbo and Zero, offering a preferential
setting, with fallback; and agnostic to the incorporation of additional Enodia features.

In Greek mythology, Enodia watched over entrances, standing on the main road into a city, 
and in the roads to private houses. She also was associated with crossroads, light, and 
passages between ~worlds.  Prior Enodia code contributions are spread between:

 - https://github.com/ullmer/enoPivy
 - https://github.com/ullmer/enoSolid
 - https://github.com/ullmer/enoTurtle
 - https://github.com/ullmer/plasma-java-jelly
... and then some (sigh).

Switching to Pygame Turbo
-------------------------

If you've been working with Pygame Zero so far and want to use some of the
new features in Pygame Turbo, it's easy to switch over.

First, install the ``pgturbo`` pip-package::

    pip install pgturbo

If you've been running your game with the command ``pgzrun`` from the command
line, you can simply switch to running it with the command ``pgtrun`` instead.

If you've been using ``import pgzrun`` and ``pgzrun.go()`` in your main script,
you only have to change these to ``import pgtrun`` and ``pgtrun.go()``.

That's it!


Divergence to Pygame Zero
-------------------------

This is a changelog which keeps track of which changes exist in respect to the
main Pygame Zero project. If and when those features are added to Pygame Zero,
they will be removed from the running list.


New features
''''''''''''

* Sprite animation system for actors, easy to start using but with deep
  customization available.
* A proper ``mouse`` builtin to get the state of different mouse properties
  like positions, relative movements, state of buttons being pressed and
  more. Also allows changing of visibility, cursor shape and others.
* Easy to use and feature rich controller support making coding games with
  controller controls easy while also allowing multiple controllers for
  multiplayer support with simple interfaces.
* Convenience functions for ``clock`` that allow checking total elapsed time
  and saving timestamps with names and checking them / time elapsed since their
  creation.
* ``clock.timescale`` property that allows slowing down, speeding up or pausing
  the game time. Integrating the different timescale with actor movements or
  other time relevant code is up to the user.
* Global ready timers in ``clock`` and for each individual actors that make
  tracking if triggerable thing or cooldown is ready far easier.
* Take screenshots with F12 in the game window or manually from code with
  ``screen.screenshot()``.


Feature enhancements
''''''''''''''''''''

* Pixel perfect collision check between two actors via
  ``actor1.collidemask(actor2)``.
* Scaling actors and flipping their images both independently for X and Y.
* ``width`` and ``height`` are now proper gettable and settable properties for
  actors. Alternative properties allow reading the dimensions of the actors
  bounding box when rotated.
* Angle and target-based movement functions for Actors, similar to what is
  possible in Scratch and other environments.
* Velocity property and movement function for Actors that only move in
  straigth lines. Also includes an intercept function to calculate necessary
  velocity to meet a target actor that also has a constant velocity.
* Create Actors from simple shapes without needing an image, via
  ``Actor.Rectangle(width, height, color)``,
  ``Actor.Ellipse(width, height, color)`` and
  ``Actor.Triangle(width, height, color)``.
* Function to check if an actor is currently withing the screen bounds:
  ``.is_onscreen()``.
* Setting movement limits for actors for example to keep them on the screen.
* More understandable error reporting for wrong positional values.
* String color names are spellchecked to make fixing typos easier.
* Schedule functions with arguments instead of only ones without any.
* Optionally schedule functions in absolute time unaffected by
  ``clock.timescale``.
* Aligned usage of ``music`` builtin with the other resource loaders for less
  friction in use.


Bug fixes
'''''''''

* Fixed ``music.is_playing()`` requiring an argument.
* Fixed a bug where creating actors outside of functions in IDE mode (importing
  ``pgtrun`` and using ``pgtrun.go()`` at the end of the game file led to a
  crash because no display was initialized when image operations are performed
  by PGTurbo.


Dependencies
''''''''''''

* Switched the base dependency from ``pygame`` to ``pygame-ce`` as it is being
  developed more actively and causes fewer installation problems.
* Removed the dependency on ``pyfxr`` for tone synthesis. The same
  functionality is now provided with ``numpy`` and ``pygame`` themselves.

Integrated changes
''''''''''''''''''

These former divergences between Pygame Turbo and Pygame Zero have been
introduced to Pygame Zero itself:

None so far.
