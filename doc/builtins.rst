Built-in Objects
================

Pygame Turbo provides useful built-in objects to help you make games easily.


.. _screen:

Screen
------

.. toctree::
    :hidden:

    ptext

The ``screen`` object represents your game screen.

It is a thin wrapper around a Pygame surface that allows you to easily
draw images to the screen ("blit" them).

.. class:: Screen

    .. attribute:: surface

        The raw `Pygame surface`_ that represents the screen buffer. You can
        use this for advanced graphics operations.

        .. _`Pygame surface`: https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surface.html

    .. method:: bounds()

        .. versionadded:: 1.3

        Return a ZRect representing the bounds of the screen.

    .. method:: clear()

        Reset the screen to black.

    .. method:: fill((red, green, blue), [gcolor=(r, g, b)])

        Fill the screen with a solid color.

        .. versionadded:: 1.3

            If ``gcolor`` is given then fill with a gradient, from ``color`` at
            the top of the screen to ``gcolor`` at the bottom.

    .. method:: blit(image, (left, top))

        Draw the image to the screen at the given position.

        ``blit()`` accepts either a Surface or a string as its ``image``
        parameter. If ``image`` is a ``str`` then the named image will be
        loaded from the ``images/`` directory.

    .. method:: screenshot()

        .. versionadded:: 1.8
        
        Takes a screenshot of the entire game window and saves it to
        the ``pgturbo`` folder in your home ``Pictures`` directory.

        Returns the path of the file that was written, as a string.

        You can press F12 to take a screenshot at any time, without needing to
        call this function manually from your game code.

    .. method:: draw.line(start, end, (r, g, b), width=1)

        Draw a line from start to end with a certain line width.

    .. method:: draw.circle(pos, radius, (r, g, b), width=1)

        Draw the outline of a circle with a certain line width.

    .. method:: draw.filled_circle(pos, radius, (r, g, b))

        Draw a filled circle.

    .. method:: draw.rect(rect, (r, g, b), width=1)

        Draw the outline of a rectangle with a certain line width.

        Takes a :ref:`Rect <rect>`.

    .. method:: draw.filled_rect(rect, (r, g, b))

        Draw a filled rectangle.

    .. method:: draw.text(text, [pos], **kwargs)

        Draw text.

        There's an extremely rich API for positioning and formatting text; see
        :doc:`ptext` for full details.

    .. method:: draw.textbox(text, rect, **kwargs)

        Draw text, sized to fill the given :ref:`Rect`.

        There's an extremely rich API for formatting text; see
        :doc:`ptext` for full details.

.. tip::

    All of the colours can be specified as ``(r, g, b)`` tuples, or by
    name, using one of :doc:`Pygame's colour names <colors_ref>`

.. _rect:

Rect
----

The `Pygame Rect`_ class is available as a built in. This can be used in a
variety of ways, from detecting clicks within a region to drawing a box onto
the screen:

For example, you can draw a box with::

    RED = 200, 0, 0
    BOX = Rect((20, 20), (100, 100))

    def draw():
        screen.draw.rect(BOX, RED)


.. _`Pygame Rect`: https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html


Resource Loading
----------------

The ``images`` and ``sounds`` objects can be used to load images and sounds
from files stored in the ``images`` and ``sounds`` subdirectories respectively.
Pygame Turbo will handle loading of these resources on demand and will cache
them to avoid reloading them.

You generally need to ensure that your images are named with lowercase letters,
numbers and underscores only. They also have to start with a letter.

File names like these will work well with the resource loader::

    alien.png
    alien_hurt.png
    alien_run_7.png

These will not work::

    3.png
    3degrees.png
    my-cat.png
    sam's dog.png

The resource loader caches loaded images and sounds. To clear the cache (for
instance, if you are running into memory issues), use the `unload()` and
`unload_all()` functions.

Example::

    cow = Actor('cow')
    loader.images.unload('cow')  # clears the cache of cow.png
    loader.images.unload_all()  # clears all cached image files


Images
''''''

Pygame Turbo can load images in ``.png``, ``.gif``, and ``.jpg`` formats. PNG is
recommended: it will allow high quality images with transparency.

We need to ensure an images directory is set up. If your project contains the
following files::

    space_game.py
    images/alien.png

Then ``space_game.py`` could draw the 'alien' sprite to the screen with this
code::

    def draw():
        screen.clear()
        screen.blit('alien', (10, 10))

The name passed to ``blit()`` is the name of the image file within the images
directory, without the file extension.

Or using the :ref:`actor` API, ::

    alien = Actor('alien')

    def draw():
        alien.draw()

There are some restrictions on the file names in both cases: they may only
contain lowercase latin letters, numbers and underscores. This is to prevent
compatibility problems when your game is played on a different operating system
that has different case sensitivity.

Image Surfaces
''''''''''''''

You can also load images from the ``images`` directory using the ``images``
object. This allows you to work with the image data itself, query its
dimensions and so on::

    forest = []
    for i in range(5):
        forest.append(
            Actor('tree', topleft=(images.tree.get_width() * i, 0))
        )

Each loaded image is a Pygame ``Surface``. You will typically use
``screen.blit(...)`` to draw this to the screen. It also provides handy methods
to query the size of the image in pixels:

.. class:: Surface

    .. method:: get_width()

        Returns the width of the image in pixels.

    .. method:: get_height()

        Returns the height of the image in pixels.

    .. method:: get_size()

        Returns a tuple (width, height) indicating the size in pixels of the
        surface.

    .. method:: get_rect()

        Get a :class:`Rect` that is pre-populated with the bounds of the image
        if the image was located at the origin.

        Effectively this is equivalent to::

            Rect((0, 0), image.get_size())


Sounds
''''''

Pygame Turbo can load sounds in multiple different formats: ``.wav``, ``.mp3``,
``.ogg``, ``.oga``, ``.flac`` and ``.opus``. You'll likely most often work with
``.wav``, ``.mp3`` or ``.ogg`` files since you can find many great sound and
music files in these formats online for free to use in your games.

We need to ensure a sounds directory is set up. If your project contains the
following files::

    drum_kit.py
    sounds/drum.wav

Then ``drum_kit.py`` could play the drum sound whenever the mouse is clicked
with this code::

    def on_mouse_down():
        sounds.drum.play()

Each loaded sound is a Pygame ``Sound``, and has various methods to play and
stop the sound as well as query its length in seconds:

.. method:: sounds.filename.play()
    :noindex:

    Play the sound.

.. method:: sounds.filename.play(loops)

    Play the sound, but loop it a number of times.

    :param loops: The number of times to loop. If you pass ``-1`` as the
                  number of times to loop, the sound will loop forever (or
                  until you call :meth:`.Sound.stop()`

.. method:: sounds.filename.stop()

    Stop playing the sound.

.. method:: sounds.filename.get_length()

    Get the duration of the sound in seconds.

You should avoid using the ``sounds`` object to play longer pieces of music.
Because the sounds sytem will fully load the music into memory before playing
it, this can use a lot of memory, as well as introducing a delay while the
music is loaded.


.. _music:

Music
-----

.. versionadded:: 1.1

.. versionchanged:: 1.12

A built-in object called ``music`` provides access to play music from within
a ``music/`` directory (alongside your ``images/`` and ``sounds/`` directories,
if you have them). The music system will load the track a little bit at a time
while the music plays, avoiding the problems with using ``sounds`` to play
longer tracks. Just like for for sounds, the supported formats are ``.wav``,
``.mp3``, ``.ogg``, ``.oga``, ``.flac`` and ``.opus``.

Only one music track can play at a time. If you play a different file, it will
replace the previous one. To play a track, reference it like you would a sound
as an attribute of the ``music`` builtin and call ``play()`` on it::

    music.main_menu.play()

This would play the file ``main_menu.ogg`` or ``main_menu.mp3`` or any other
valid format found in the ``music`` directory next to your main game file. The
following methods are available to use with any music track:

.. method:: music.filename.play()

    Play the music track, looping indefinitely.

    This replaces the currently playing track and cancels any tracks previously
    queued with ``queue()``.

    You do not need to include the extension in the track name; for example, to
    play the file ``handel.mp3`` on a loop::

        music.handel.play()

.. method:: music.filename.play_once()

    Similar to ``play()``, but the music will stop after playing through once.

.. method:: music.filename.queue()

    Prepares the track to be played once after the current track finishes
    playing. This only makes sense to use if you used ``play_once()`` before.
    If you have the current music looping indefinitely, the queued track will
    never play.

To interact with running music, you use methods directly on the ``music``
builtin itself:

.. method:: music.stop()

    Stop music playback.

.. method:: music.pause()

    Pause the music temporarily. It can be resumed by calling ``unpause()``.

.. method:: music.unpause()

    Unpause music playback that was previously paused.

.. method:: music.is_playing()

    Returns ``True`` if music is currently playing, ``False`` otherwise.

.. method:: music.is_paused()

    Returns ``True`` only if there is a current music track but it is paused,
    ``False`` otherwise.

.. method:: music.fadeout(duration)

    Fade out and eventually stop the current music playback.

    :param duration: The duration in seconds over which the sound will be faded
                     out. For example, to fade out over half a second, call
                     ``music.fadeout(0.5)``.

.. method:: music.set_volume(volume)

    Set the volume of the music system.

    This takes a number between ``0.0`` (meaning silent) and ``1.0`` (meaning
    full volume).

    By default, the music volume is set to ``0.75``.

.. method:: music.get_volume()

    Get the current volume of the music system.


The :func:`on_music_end() hook <on_music_end>` triggers whenever music stops
playing, so both when you stop playback explicitely with ``music.stop()`` but
also when a track you played with ``music.filename.play_once()`` is done.

It does NOT trigger when a looping track finishes playing through once and
begins to play again.


.. warning::

    There can be some cross-platform compatibility issues around audio file
    formats.

    In particular:

    * MP3 may not be available on some Linux distributions, though this should
      be fixed by installing the necessary package for MP3 support for that
      distribution.
    * Some OGG Vorbis files seem to hang Pygame with 100% CPU. This might be
      fixed by re-encoding the file (possibly using a different encoder).


.. note::

    The recommended way to play music tracks is via ``music.filename.play()``
    since this mirrors how the other resource loaders (``images`` and
    ``sounds``) are used.

    For backwards compatibility however, you can also still use the old way
    instead: ``music.play("filename")``, ``music.play_once("filename")`` and
    ``music.queue("filename")``.


.. _mouse:

Mouse
-----

The built-in mouse object can be used to get information of various current
states of the mouse in the game: where it is, what buttons are pressed,
whether it is visible and many more...

It can also be used to manipulate the mouse, for example changing its position
or the displayed mouse cursor.


.. class:: Mouse

    .. attribute:: pressed

        Returns a tuple of three booleans for the left, middle and right
        mouse buttons in order. True means the button is currently pressed.

    .. attribute:: pressed_left

        Returns True if the left mouse button is currently pressed,
        False else.

    .. attribute:: pressed_middle

        Returns True if the middle mouse button is currently pressed,
        False else.

    .. attribute:: pressed_right

        Returns True if the right mouse button is currently pressed,
        False else.

    .. attribute:: pos

        Returns the current position of the mouse.

        Setting this will teleport the mouse to the supplied position
        inside the game window.

    .. attribute:: last_called_pos

        Returns the position of the mouse at the time this value
        was last read.

    .. attribute:: recent_pos

        Returns a tuple of the n last positions the mouse had moved
        to starting from the most recent. Default for n is 60 and
        can be changed via recent_pos_max.

    .. attribute:: recent_pos_max

        Returns the total number of positions tracked via recent_pos.

        Increasing this value simply extends the length of the queue
        of tracked positions. Decreasing it also cuts the queue to the
        new maximum number of elements.

    .. attribute:: rel

        Returns the relative position change of the mouse over the last
        frame.

    .. attribute:: last_called_rel

        Returns the relative position change of the mouse since this
        value was last read.

    .. attribute:: recent_rel

        Returns a tuple of the n last position changes the mouse had,
        starting from the most recent. Default for n is 60 and
        can be changed via recent_rel_max.

    .. attribute:: recent_rel_max

        Returns the total number of position changed tracked via
        recent_pos.

        Increasing this value simply extends the length of the queue
        of tracked positions. Decreasing it also cuts the queue to the
        new maximum number of elements.

    .. attribute:: visible

        Returns a boolean of whether the mouse cursor is currently
        visible.

        Setting this to either a boolean or 0 or 1 makes the mouse
        visible or invisible.

    .. attribute:: focused

        Returns a boolean of whether the game window is currently
        focused.

    .. attribute:: cursor

        Returns a tuple with two elements: the name string of the
        current cursor and the hotspot of the cursor if it is known.

        Setting this loads a new cursor and applies it to the mouse.
        This can be done with either one string, or one string and
        a hotspot position tuple at the same time.

        For a more detailed explanation, see below.

    .. attribute:: cursor_name

        Returns the current name string of the mouse cursor.

    .. attribute:: cursor_hotspot

        Returns the hotspot tuple of the current cursor or None
        if the hotspot is unknown (because it is a system cursor).


Recent pos and rel
''''''''''''''''''

The ``mouse.recent_pos`` and ``mouse.recent_rel`` attributes allow
you to get the last recorded positions and relative movements from
any mouse movement event. This can be used among other things to
make visual effects of things "following" the mouse. Here is an
example that draws a trail of circles behind the mouse::

    def draw():
        for p in mouse.recent_pos:
            screen.draw.circle(p, 5, "red")

How many events back are recorded is controlled by ``recent_pos_max``
and ``recent_rel_max``. It's important to note here that these
attributes don't record the position and relative movement for each
frame, like ``mouse.rel`` for example does, but rather the positions
and changes for each individual mouse movement event. Since multiple
mouse movement events can happen in a single frame, there is no fixed
relationship between the number of frames passed and the recorded
positions and relative changes. In general though, a higher maximum
value means positions and changes from longer before will still be
recorded.

Cursors
'''''''

Many games change how the mouse cursor looks. PGTurbo lets you control
this by setting the ``mouse.cursor`` attribute. There are two options
here: system cursors or custom cursors.

Windows, MacOS and Linux systems all come with a variety of pre-made
cursor shapes ready to use. To change to any of them, simply use
``mouse.cursor = "ARROW"`` where *"ARROW"* is usually the default cursor
on your system. To use something else, simply change the string to one
of these options: *"ARROW", "IBEAM", "WAIT", "CROSSHAIR", "HAND"*.

If you want to use a custom cursor from an image you have in the
``images`` folder, just call ``mouse.cursor = "image_name"`` and the
cursor will automatically be loaded from the image resource.

When using a custom cursor, you might also want to tell PGTurbo where
in the image the spot is, where an actual mouse click should occur.
The default cursor of most systems has this in the top left corner of
the cursor image but yours could have it in the center (think shooter
crosshairs), in the top middle (a pointing hand maybe) or anywhere else.

To tell PGTurbo where to put the actual point, you can also give a hotspot
tuple when setting the cursor: ``mouse.cursor = "image_name", (12, 0)``.

This tells the game that when you press a mouse button, the click should
happen not at the top left corner of the cursor image, but 12 pixels to
the right of it. This might be the top middle for a cursor with an image
size of 24x24 pixels. The center for a 40x40 pixels cursor would be
``(20, 20)``.

This tuple is simply a position tuple like the kind we already know about.
The only difference is that it looks for the position to put mouse clicks
not in relation to the top left corner of the game window, but just the
cursor image.

System cursors define their own hotspot, so you don't have to worry about
them. This also means you can't manually check the hotspot of system
cursors with ``mouse.cursor_hotspot`` however. This will return ``None``
when a system cursor is in use.

LEFT or pressed_left
''''''''''''''''''''

While both are accessed via ``mouse``, ``mouse.LEFT`` and
``mouse.pressed_left`` are different things. ``mouse.LEFT`` is used
in your custom functions that handle mouse events, e.g.
``if button == mouse.LEFT`` whereas ``mouse.pressed`` and its variants
can be used outside of these, for example in the ``update()`` function to
check whether a mouse button is pressed at that moment.

Example::

    def on_mouse_down(button):
        if button == mouse.LEFT:
            play_tune()

    def update():
        if mouse.pressed_right:
            fireworks()


``mouse.WHEELUP`` and ``mouse.WHEELDOWN`` have no equivalent outside of
``on_mouse`` functions since these can't be held down.


.. _controllers:

Controllers
-----------

PGTurbo supports one or multiple game controllers for use as input devices.
There are two builtin objects to use: ``joy`` and ``joysticks``.

.. _joy:

joy
'''

``joy`` is the easy and accessible way to check for the state of connected
controllers. If you want to support just one controller as an input method
just like a keyboard or a mouse, then you can think of ``joy`` the same way
you do of ``keyboard`` to check if a key is pressed down or not::

    def update():
        if joy.face_down:
            move_speed = 15
        else:
            move_speed = 10

        player.x = player.x + joy.left_x * move_speed
        player.y = player.y + joy.left_y * move_speed

In the same way, you can also use the current state of a controller axis
like a thumbstick. In the example, we change the movement speed of the player
if the the lower face button is held down. Then, we change the players position
based on the left stick deflection. Since the axis returns values from -1 to 1
we have to multiply this by however fast we want the Actor to move at most.

It's that easy to get smooth controller movement with varying speeds based on
how far a stick is pushed. ``joy`` has the following attributes that you can
use:

.. class:: Joystick

    .. attribute:: face_up

        Returns ``True`` if the upper face button is currently held down.
        ``face_down``, ``face_left`` and ``face_right`` are also
        available.

    .. attribute:: dpad_up

        Returns ``True`` if the DPAD is held up. ``dpad_down``,
        ``dpad_left`` and ``dpad_right`` are also available.

    .. attribute:: shoulder_left

        Returns ``True`` if the left shoulder button is pressed down.
        ``shoulder_right`` is also available.

    .. attribute:: push_left

        Returns ``True`` if the left thumbstick is pressed in.
        ``push_right`` is also available.

    .. attribute:: center_left

        Returns ``True`` if the left most button on the controller front is
        pressed. ``center_middle`` and ``center_right`` are also
        available.

        *Note:* Left, middle and right buttons usually correspond to the
        physical locations on the controller, but there may be some devices
        where this is not true.

    .. attribute:: left_x

        Returns the value of the X axis of the left thumbstick (horizontal
        movement). Values range from -1 to 1 with -1 being fully pressed left,
        0 being centered and 1 being fully pressed right. ``right_x`` is
        also available.

    .. attribute:: left_y

        Returns the value of the Y axis of the left thumbstick (vertical
        movement). Values range from -1 to 1 with -1 being fully pressed up,
        0 being centered and 1 being fully pressed down. ``right_x`` is
        also available.

    .. attribute:: left_stick

        Returns the values of both axes of the left thumbstick as a tuple of
        two floats between -1 and 1. ``right_stick`` ist also available.

    .. attribute:: left_angle

        Returns the angle to which the left thumbstick is currently held with
        0 degrees indicating straight right (see :ref:`rotation` of Actors).
        ``right_angle`` is also available.

        If the stick is centered, ``None`` is returned.

    .. attribute:: left_trigger

        Returns the value of the left trigger axis as a float between 0 and 1
        with 0 being unpressed and 1 being fully pressed in. ``right_trigger``
        is also available.

    .. attribute:: name

        Returns the human readable name of the controller as a string.

    .. attribute:: guid

        Returns the unique hardware identifier of the controller as a string.

    .. attribute:: instance_id

        Returns the integer index by which the controller is identified in
        PGTurbo. This is used to get access to a specific controller (see
        :ref:`joysticks`) or to determine which controller triggered an event.


``joy`` is a special controller object that is always available and always safe
to access. Even if no actual controller is connected, ``joy`` will always be
available and simply report all buttons unpressed and all axes in neutral
position. This is because ``joy`` is a virtual controller that is affected
by any controller input.

That means that when ``face_up`` is pressed on any connected controller,
``face_up`` will be pressed on ``joy``. If at the same time the left stick is
moved on a different controller, ``joy`` will mirror that movement.

It's done this way to make coding a game with support for a single controller
as easy as possible. If you want a single person to control your game with a
controller, you don't need to think about anything else, you can use ``joy``
and it will just work. The only downside is that ``name``, ``guid`` and
``instance_id`` of ``joy`` will not report the values for the actual controller
used but instead generic stand-ins.

If you want support for multiple controllers, then you use the ``joysticks``
object.


.. _joysticks:

joysticks
'''''''''

The ``joysticks`` object acts as a manager for the connected joystick devices.
It works like a dictionary that you can only read from, not change manually,
that also has some additional functions. Each entry has the ``instance_id``
of the controller as its key with the value being the actual Joystick object.
It automatically tracks connected devices and their inputs, so the only thing
you need to think about it accessing the right controller. This works the
following way::

    if len(joysticks) >= 2:
        cons = joysticks.keys()
        player_1_con = joysticks[cons[0]]
        player_2_con = joysticks[cons[1]]

Because ``joysticks`` works like a dictionary, you can get the number of
connected devices with ``len(joysticks)``. ``joysticks.keys()`` gives you
all IDs of the connected controllers. Since the IDs are the key for the
``joysticks`` dictionary, you can get any Joystick object with
``joysticks[instance_id]``. In this case, we assign the first two connected
devices to player 1 and player 2 as their controllers. We save them in
variables to have easier access to them later and if a device is disconnected,
we can assign a different controller to that player.

Using specific joysticks works exactly the same as using ``joy``. Here's an
example of how to differentiate controls between joysticks::

    def update():
        if player_1_con:
            p1_actor.x = p1_actor.x + player_1_con.left_x * move_speed
            p1_actor.y = p1_actor.y + player_1_con.left_y * move_speed

        if player_2_con:
            p2_actor.x = p2_actor.x + player_2_con.left_x * move_speed
            p2_actor.y = p2_actor.y + player_2_con.left_y * move_speed

Since we aren't working with ``joy`` anymore but with specific devices,
we always have to make sure to account for the possibility of them being
disconnected. If that happens, whatever access method we used before
(directly via ``joysticks`` or with a variable) will return ``None``
instead. This way, simply checking ``if con_object:`` let's us only run
code if a valid device can be reached.

If a device is disconnected, an event is triggered that can be reacted
to by defining an ``on_joy_removed()`` function. Here, we could assign
``player_1_con`` to a different joystick object, if the previous one is
disconnected. More information on this can be found in the section on
:ref:`joystick event hooks <joystick-hooks>`.

It's common to assign controllers based on which one was last used. To
make this possible, ``joysticks.last_used`` returns the Joystick object
that last recorded an input. If you want your players to be able to pick
their controllers, simply tell them to make any input and then assign them
``joysticks.last_used`` one after the other.

**Important:** Since ``joysticks`` automatically updates the connected
controllers, we can't change the contents of the "dictionary" it represents.
Trying to do something like ``joysticks[5] = ...`` will result in an error.


.. _clock:

Clock
-----

Often when writing a game, you will want to schedule some game event to occur
at a later time. For example, we may want a big boss alien to appear after 60
seconds. Or perhaps a power-up will appear every 20 seconds.

More subtle are the situations when you want to delay some action for a shorter
period. For example you might have a laser weapon that takes 1 second to charge
up.

We can use the ``clock`` object to schedule a function to happen in the
future.

Let's start by defining a function ``fire_laser`` that we want to run in the
future::

    def fire_laser():
        lasers.append(player.pos)

Then when the fire button is pressed, we will ask the ``clock`` to call it for
us after exactly 1 second::

    def on_mouse_down():
        clock.schedule(fire_laser, 1.0)

Note that ``fire_laser`` is the function itself; without parentheses, it is
not being called here! The clock will call it for us.

(It is a good habit to write out times in seconds with a decimal point, like
``1.0``. This makes it more obvious when you are reading it back, that you are
referring to a time value and not a count of things.)


Scheduling with arguments
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

.. versionadded:: 1.7

The ``fire_laser`` function above doesn't need to be called with any arguments,
but what if you want to schedule a function that does take arguments?

Let's image a game about mining where differently colored gems pop up from time
to time. It would be easiest to have just one function that creates a new gem
that can do so with different colors and positions::

    def create_gem(color, posx, posy):
        new_gem = Actor("gem_" + color, (posx, posy))
        gems.append(new_gem)

When you schedule function calls that need arguments, you need to give these
after the callable and delay in the clock call::

    clock.schedule(create_gem, 4.5, "red", 240, 120)

Any values you give ``schedule``, ``schedule_unique`` or ``schedule_interval``
after the delay will simply be passed on to the function call as arguments when
it happens.

Note that if you schedule a function with arguments, you also need to
``unschedule()`` it with the same arguments to stop it from being called. If
you want to remove all calls to a certain function regardless of arguments,
simply use ``clock.unschedule_all(callable)``.


Elapsed time and marks
''''''''''''''''''''''

.. versionadded:: 1.4

Another use of clock is to keep track of elapsed time in different ways. If you
just want to get the total time since the program started, ``clock.time``
will return how many seconds have passed. Often though, we are more interested
in how much time has gone by since a certain starting moment like the start of
a round for example::

    def update():
        if keyboard.space and round_over:
            clock.mark_time("game_begin")
            # ...
        # ...
        if opponent.colliderect(player) and not round_over:
            time_played = clock.time_since_mark("game_begin")
            # ...

In the example, a round is started when the space key is pressed. Besides
everything else that needs to happen to start the game, we remember when the
game was started with ``clock.mark_time()``. We called the mark "game_begin" so
that's what we need to use later again.

When the round ends (when the opponent touches the player) we can then get the
length of the round by calling ``clock.time_since_mark()`` with the name of the
mark we set up before.

Since times are returned in seconds, they are often long fractions of whole
numbers. If you want to display time values in the game window, consider
converting the timestamp to a whole number with ``int(timestamp)`` first.
``int()`` from a ``float`` will always round down, which is usually desirable
for displaying elapsed seconds.


Timescale
'''''''''

.. versionadded:: 1.6

To change how fast time is running in your game, you can set
``clock.timescale``. ``2.0`` would make all clock related things
happen twice as fast, where ``0`` would effectively pause the clock. If you
scheduled a function call to happen in two seconds and then did
``clock.timescale = 0.5`` right afterwards, the function would only be
called four seconds later in real time. If you want your whole game to respect
this timescale you need to make sure anything involving movement or counting
over time is affected by the timescale::

    def update():
        if keyboard.w:
            alien.y -= 10 * clock.timescale

Now when you change the timescale, it will look to the player like the whole
game has slowed down, sped up or been paused.

This also affects the reported elapsed times by ``clock.time``
and time marks. This is usually good, but if you want to get the total time
elapsed since program start without respecting changes to timescale, you can
get it with ``clock.absolute_time``.

.. versionadded:: 1.10

In the same way, you can do anything related to scheduling in an absolute
timeframe too. Simply pass ``absolute=True`` to functions like ``schedule()``
and the callback you schedule will be unaffected by ``timescale``. If you want
to unschedule this event, you also need to do so with
``unschedule(callback, absolute=True)``. Internally, clock maintains two
separate queues, one affected by ``timeframe`` and one not. So if you do
anything with ``absolute=True``, you'll need to pass the same when wanting to
check or affect it later.

It's recommended to always put ``absolute=True`` as the last argument in your
scheduling calls so you don't accidentally mess up the order of arguments you
might want to feed to the scheduled callback. This also means that ``absolute``
is the one keyword that cannot be used in your own callback signatures as it is
intercepted for the use of ``clock`` and not passed on to the callback
functions.

Marks always save a timestamp in absolute time and in the time affected by
timescale. If you want to get either their timestamp or the elapsed time since
marking in absolute time, simply call any of the associated methods with
``absolute=True`` or just ``True`` as a second argument.


.. _clock_ready_timers:

Ready timers
''''''''''''

.. versionadded:: 1.10

Often in games you'll want to only allow certain things to happen if they are
"ready". Say for example a character has a special ability to jump higher than
normal but they should only be able to do that again after five seconds have
passed. For any such scenario, you can use clock ready timers. To do so, first
you add something to track::

    clock.track_ready("superjump", 5.0)

Now you can check whether the tracked thing is ready like so::

    clock.is_ready("superjump")

This will return ``True`` if the ability can be used. If the ability is used,
you can then disable it for the timeout duration you added it with before as
follows::

    def update():
        if keyboard.space and clock.is_ready("superjump"):
            player.vy -= 25
            clock.timeout_ready("superjump")

When you call ``timeout_ready(name)`` the ready timer of the given name will be
set to ``False`` and only be set back to ``True`` once five seconds have passed
in this case.

If you want to add many different things to track, you can either call
``clock.track_ready()`` multiple times or add each ability as a tuple of a name
and the timeout period:
``clock.track_ready(("superjump", 5.0), ("slide", 2.5), ("jump", 0.75))``


``clock`` provides the following useful methods:

.. class:: Clock

    .. attribute:: time

        Returns the elapsed time while respecting timescale changes.

        Cannot be set by the user.

    .. attribute:: absolute_time

        Returns the elapsed time without respecting timescale changes.

        This always returns the actual second count since program start.

        Cannot be set by the user.

    .. attribute:: timescale

        Controls the speed at which time is counted for ``time`` property and
        scheduling of function calls.

        ``1.0`` is normal game time, values above will increase the speed while
        values between 0 and 1 slow the timing down. ``0.0`` will pause the
        time counting. This can be used to pause the game when set up
        correctly.

    .. method:: schedule(callback, delay, *args, **kwargs)

        Schedule `callback` to be called after the given delay.

        Repeated calls will schedule the callback repeatedly.

        Calling with ``absolute=True`` will schedule the callback such that it
        will not be affected by timescale.

        :param callback: A callable (usually a function you wrote).
        :param delay: The delay, in seconds, before the function should be
                      called.
        :param args: Any further arguments will be given to callback as
                     positional arguments when called.
        :param kwargs: Any further named arguments will be given to callback
                       as keyword arguments when called.

                       Note that the keyword `absolute` is reserved and won't
                       be passed on.

    .. method:: schedule_unique(callback, delay, *args, **kwargs)

        Schedule `callback` to be called once after the given delay.

        If `callback` was already scheduled, cancel and reschedule it. This
        applies also if it was scheduled multiple times: after calling
        ``schedule_unique``, it will be scheduled exactly once.

        Calling with ``absolute=True`` will schedule the callback such that it
        will not be affected by timescale.

        :param callback: A callable (usually a function you wrote).
        :param delay: The delay, in seconds, before the function should be
                      called.
        :param args: Any further arguments will be given to callback as
                     positional arguments when called.
        :param kwargs: Any further named arguments will be given to callback
                       as keyword arguments when called.

                       Note that the keyword `absolute` is reserved and won't
                       be passed on.

    .. method:: schedule_interval(callback, interval, *args, **kwargs)

        Schedule `callback` to be called repeatedly.

        Calling with ``absolute=True`` will schedule the callback such that it
        will not be affected by timescale.

        :param callback: A callable (usually a function you wrote).
        :param interval: The interval in seconds between calls to `callback`.
        :param args: Any further arguments will be given to callback as
                     positional arguments when called.
        :param kwargs: Any further named arguments will be given to callback
                       as keyword arguments when called.

                       Note that the keyword `absolute` is reserved and won't
                       be passed on.

    .. method:: unschedule(callback, *args, **kwargs)

        Unschedule only the callback with the given arguments if it has
        been previously scheduled (either because it had been scheduled with
        ``schedule()`` and has not yet been called, or because it had been
        scheduled to repeat with ``schedule_interval()``.

        This means that if you scheduled ``set_gem_color`` with ``"red"`` and
        ``"blue"`` for separate delays before and then call
        ``clock.unschedule(set_gem_color, "red")`` only the call with ``"red"``
        as an argument will be unscheduled.

        Calling with ``absolute=True`` will schedule the callback such that it
        will not be affected by timescale.

        :param callback: A callable (usually a function you wrote).
        :param args: Any further arguments will be used to identify which
                     specific scheduled call to remove.
        :param kwargs: Any further named arguments will be used to identify
                       which specific scheduled call to remove.

                       Note that the keyword `absolute` is reserved and won't
                       be passed on.

    .. method:: unschedule_all(callback, [absolute])

        Unschedule all calls of the given callback, ignoring any arguments
        supplied to them.

        This means that if you scheduled ``set_gem_color`` with ``"red"`` and
        ``"blue"`` for separate delays before, both will be unscheduled.

        Calling with ``absolute=True`` will unschedule those callbacks that had
        been scheduled to be unaffected by timescale before.

        :param callback: A callable (usually a function you wrote).
        :param absolute: Boolean of whether to unschedule the callbacks in the
                         absolute time event queue or the other one. Default is
                         ``False``.

Note that the Pygame Turbo clock only holds weak references to each callback
you give it. It will not fire scheduled events if the objects and methods are
not referenced elsewhere. This can help prevent the clock keeping objects
alive and continuing to fire unexpectedly after they are otherwise dead.

The downside to the weak references is that you won't be able to schedule
lambdas or any other object that has been created purely to be scheduled. You
will have to keep a reference to the object.

    .. method:: mark_time(name)

        Creates a record of the current elapsed time and saves it with the
        given `name`. Use this to save when something happened in the game.
        Calling the function again overwrites the previous timestamp with the
        new one.

        Saves both the absolute timestamp and the one affected by timescale.

        :param name: A string name for the time mark.

    .. method:: get_mark_time(name, [absolute])

        Returns the timestamp that was saved under `name`. If the mark does
        not exist (yet), returns ``None`` instead.

        :param name: A string name for the time mark.
        :param absolute: Boolean of whether to return the absolute timestamp
                         instead of the one affected by timescale. Default is
                         ``False``.

    .. method:: time_since_mark(name, [absolute])

        Returns the time elapsed since the mark `name` was created. If the
        mark does not exist (yet), returns ``None`` instead.

        :param name: A string name for the time mark.
        :param absolute: Boolean of whether to return the absolute time since
                         the mark was created instead of the one affected by
                         timescale. Default is ``False``.

    .. method:: get_all_marks([absolute])

        Returns a dictionary of all currently saved marks and their timestamps.
        Note that changing this dictionary does not affect the underlying data
        in clock.

        :param absolute: Boolean of whether to return all the absolute
                         timestamps instead of the ones affected by timescale.
                         Default is False.

    .. method:: track_ready(*args)

        Adds one or multiple ready timers that the clock can return and
        time out. If given one string and one number, a single ready timer is
        added. If you want to add multiple, call the function with tuples where
        each tuple contains one string and one number for the timers.

        :param args: Argument sink to turn into one or more added ready timers.

    .. method:: is_ready(name)

        Returns ``True`` if the given timer is currently ready or ``False`` if
        not.

        :param name: Name of the ready timer to check.

    .. method:: get_ready_timeout(name)

        Returns the current timeout period set for a ready timer.

        :param name: String for which timer to get the timeout period of.

    .. method:: timeout_ready(name, [time, absolute])

        Set a ready timer to ``False`` for the duration of its set timeout
        period, after which it will be returned to ``True`` again.

        :param name: The name of the ready timer to time out.
        :param time: An override for how long the timer should remain
                     ``False``. Give a number to use a timeout period other
                     than the default set for the ready timer.
        :param absolute: Boolean of whether the timeout period should be
                         tracked in absolute time or time affected by
                         timescale. Default is ``False``.

    .. method:: set_ready(name, value)

        Set the ready value of a ready timer manually and permanently. This
        could be used to disable an ability in general based on some state.
        Calling ``timeout_ready()`` will still set the timer back to ready
        after the timeout period.

        :param name: What timer to change the ready value on.
        :param value: Boolean of whether the ready timer should be permanently
                      ready (``True``) or not (``False``) until a timeout is
                      triggered.

    .. method:: set_ready_timeout(name, value)

        Set the timeout period for the given ready timer. Doesn't affect a
        timeout that is already running.

        :param name: The timer for which to change the timeout period.
        :param value: Number value for the seconds the timeout period should
                      last.

    .. method:: get_all_ready()

        Returns a dictionary of all ready timers with their names as keys and
        their ready state as values. Changing the data in this dictionary does
        not change anything about the ready timers kept by ``clock``.


.. _actor:

Actors
------

Once you have many images moving around in a game it can be convenient to have
something that holds in one place the image and where it is on screen. We'll
call each moving image on screen an ``Actor``. You can create an actor by supplying
at least an image name (from the images folder above). To draw the alien talked
about above::

    alien = Actor('alien', (50, 50))

    def draw():
        screen.clear()
        alien.draw()

You can move the actor around by setting its pos attribute in an update::

    def update():
        if keyboard.left:
            alien.x -= 1
        elif keyboard.right:
            alien.x += 1

And you may change the image used to draw the actor by setting its image
attribute to some new image name::

    alien.image = 'alien_hurt'

Actors have all the same attributes and methods as :ref:`Rect <rect>`,
including methods like `.colliderect()`__ which can be used to test whether
two actors have collided. This is quick but imperfect collision detection.

.. __: https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html#pygame.Rect.colliderect

Additionally, collisions between actors can be checked more precisely by
calling ``actor1.collidemask(actor2)``. This checks collision down to the
pixel level, meaning that if the rects of two actors overlap but their
images don't actually intersect, a collision won't be reported. This is
a lot more precise but also more work to check for. If coarse detection
is fine, always use ``.colliderect()``. If you need high precision, use
``.collidemask()`` only where it is necessary.

Positioning Actors
''''''''''''''''''

If you assign a new value to one of the position attributes then the actor will
be moved. For example::

    alien.right = WIDTH

will position the alien so its right-hand side is set to ``WIDTH``.

Similarly, you can also set the initial position of the actor in the
constructor, by passing one of these as a keyword argument: ``pos``,
``topleft``, ``topright``, ``bottomleft``, ``bottomright``, ``midtop``,
``midleft``, ``midright``, ``midbottom`` or ``center``:

.. image:: _static/actor/anchor_points.png

This can be done during creation or by assigning a pair of x, y co-ordinates.
For example::

    WIDTH = 200
    HEIGHT = 200

    alien = Actor('alien', center=(100,100))

    def draw():
        screen.clear()
        alien.draw()

.. image:: _static/actor/alien_center.png

Changing ``center=(100, 100)`` to ``midbottom=(100, 200)`` gives you:

.. image:: _static/actor/alien_midbottom.png

If you don't specify an initial position, the actor will initially be
positioned in the top-left corner (equivalent to ``topleft=(0, 0)``).


.. _actor_movement_limits:

Movement limits
'''''''''''''''

.. versionadded:: 1.11

If you want to restrict where an actor can move (for example to prevent the
player from running off the screen), you can use the "limit" properties::

    WIDTH = 800
    HEIGHT = 600

    alien = Actor("alien", (400, 300))
    alien.x_limits = (10, 790)
    alien.top_limit = None
    alien.bottom_limit = 590

These commands will limit the actors positioning so that the actor will never
cross under ten pixels distance to any window edge except the top one. Limits
always affect the outermost edge of an actor. So if you set a left limit, the
left edge of the actor will not cross under that value. Same for the right edge
and crossing over it if you set a right limit.

To set or check upper and lower limits for an axis together, use either
``x_limits`` or ``y_limits``. If you want to work with a single limit, use
``left_limit``, ``right_limit``, ``top_limit`` and ``bottom_limit``. To set no
limits on movement, use ``None`` as the value.

.. _anchor:

Anchor point
''''''''''''

Actors have an "anchor position", which is a convenient way to position the
actor in the scene. By default, the anchor position is the center, so the
``.pos`` attribute refers to the center of the actor (and so do the ``x`` and
``y`` coordinates). It's common to want to set the anchor point to another
part of the sprite (perhaps the feet - so that you can easily set the Actor to
be "standing on" something)::

    alien = Actor('alien', anchor=('center', 'bottom'))
    spaceship = Actor('spaceship', anchor=(10, 50))

``anchor`` is specified as a tuple ``(xanchor, yanchor)``, where the values can
be floats or the strings ``left``, ``center``/``middle``, ``right``, ``top`` or
``bottom`` as appropriate.


.. _scale:

Scale
'''''

.. versionadded:: 1.5

You can change the size of actors by setting the right properties::

    alien = Actor("alien", (150, 150))

    def update():
        if keyboard.space:
            alien.scale = 2
        else:
            alien.scale = 1

In the example, the "alien" actor will be twice as big whenever you hold the
spacebar down on the keyboard. ``scale`` can be set to a single value like
``2`` or ``0.5`` to change width and height to the same degree. Alternatively
you can give ``scale`` a tuple like ``(0.5, 2)`` to make the actor half as wide
and twice as tall. If you just want to control the size in one dimension, you
can also just set ``actor.scale_x`` and ``actor.scale_y`` directly::

    def update():
        if keyboard.x:
            alien.scale_x = 2
        else:
            alien.scale_x = 1

        if keyboard.y:
            alien.scale_y = 2
        else:
            alien.scale_y = 1

When changing the dimension of actors, their image will grow or shrink around
their anchor point and position. So if the anchor point is
``("center", "bottom")`` and you scale an actor up, it will "grow" upwards. If
the anchor point is centered the actor will grow in all directions
proportionally.


.. _width_and_height:

Width and height
''''''''''''''''

.. versionadded:: 1.5

Another way to control the size of an actor is to set its ``width`` and
``height`` properties, which also automatically updates the scale properties
so that both pixel dimensions and relative size are synchronized properly.
As an example, let us stretch an actor while holding down a key::

    def update():
        if keyboard.space:
            alien.width += 2

These properties always return and set the dimensions of the actor image at its
current size. When an actor is rotated however, the width and height it
occupies in total is bigger than just the image. If you want to know how much
distance an actor covers in total in the X- or Y-axis while rotated, use these
properties instead::

    alien.angle = 60
    total_height = alien.bounding_height
    total_width = alien.bounding_width

While an actor is not rotated, these are both the same as the normal ``width``
and ``height`` properties.


.. _flipping:

Flipping
''''''''

.. versionadded:: 1.5

Besides scaling actors up and down, we can also flip the actor image along the
X- and/or Y-axis. Simply set the ``flip_x`` and ``flip_y`` properties to
``True`` to do so or ``False`` to set the image to the normal orientation::

    alien = Actor("alien", (150, 200))
    alien.flip_y = True

If you just want to change whatever the current value is to the other one
(either going from not flipped to flipped or the other way around) you can use
the following code: ``player.flip_x = not player.flip_x``. The ``not`` keyword
combined with getting the current value means you will always make the flipped
state switch to whatever it is not currently on.

Flipping via the properties doesn't move an actor image at all. If for example
you have an actor with their anchor centered on the bottom and you want to
flip it so that the actor ends up "hanging" upside down in comparison to its
previous position, you can use ``flip_y_over_anchor()``. This function and
``flip_x_over_anchor()`` both flip the whole actor with the image, anchor point
and position so the result is the actor being mirrored across the anchor.

.. method:: Actor.flip_x_over_anchor()

    Mirrors the actor across the anchor point in the X axis by flipping the
    image and updating anchor and position of the actor.

.. method:: Actor.flip_y_over_anchor()

    Mirrors the actor across the anchor point in the Y axis by flipping the
    image and updating anchor and position of the actor.

*Note:* These methods of flipping change the anchor position of the actor. A
value of ``("center", "bottom")`` will become ``("center", "top")`` after using
``flip_y_over_anchor()``.


.. _rotation:

Rotation
''''''''

.. versionadded:: 1.2

The ``.angle`` attribute of an Actor controls the rotation of the sprite, in
degrees, anticlockwise (counterclockwise).

The centre of rotation is the Actor's :ref:`anchor point <anchor>`.

Note that this will change the ``bounding_width`` and ``bounding_height`` of
the Actor. These properties report the width and height of the bounding box
containing the actor and cannot be set manually.

For example, to make an asteroid sprite spinning slowly anticlockwise in
space::

    asteroid = Actor('asteroid', center=(300, 300))

    def update():
        asteroid.angle += 1

To have it spin clockwise, we'd change ``update()`` to::

    def update():
        asteroid.angle -= 1

As a different example, we could make an actor ``ship`` always face the mouse
pointer. Because :meth:`~Actor.angle_to()` returns 0 for "right", the sprite we
use for "ship" should face right::

    ship = Actor('ship')

    def on_mouse_move(pos):
        ship.angle = ship.angle_to(pos)

.. image:: _static/rotation.svg
    :alt: Diagram showing how to set up sprites for rotation with angle_to()

Remember that angles loop round, so 0 degrees == 360 degrees == 720 degrees.
Likewise -180 degrees == 180 degrees.


.. _actor_animation:

Actor animations
''''''''''''''''

.. versionadded:: 1.9

Most games don't use static images for characters but rather have lots of
animations that play whenever characters walk around, jump or just stand
around. Just like a video is a series of still images being played quickly,
animations are made by just quickly cycling the display image of an actor
through many frames in an animation. PGTurbo can do most of the work of putting
animations in your game for you.

There's two ways to get PGTurbo to recognize your animation resources. For this
quick overview we'll stick with one approach but the other is described in
detail further below.

First of all, anything to do with animations has to be placed in a folder named
``animations`` next to your game's main python file (the same place you have
your ``images`` folder as well).

Each animation is then another folder inside that ``animations`` folder. The
name of that folder will be the name under which PGTurbo finds the animation.
Place the individual frames of the animation in the folder as separate images.
Make sure the file order reflects the order of frames in the animation. Here's
an example folder structure with two animations:

.. code-block:: none

    .
    ├── animations/
    │   ├── walk_up/
    │   │   ├── walk_up_1.png
    │   │   ├── walk_up_2.png
    │   │   ├── walk_up_3.png
    │   │   └── walk_up_4.png
    │   └── idle/
    │       ├── idle_1.png
    │       └── idle_2.png
    └── main.py

With this structure, PGTurbo will be able to find and load two animations:
``walk_up`` and ``idle``. To do so, simply create an actor and load the
animations into its ``anim`` component::

    alien = Actor("alien", (150, 200), anchor=("center", "bottom"))
    alien.anim.add("walk_up", 1.5)
    alien.anim.add("idle", 1.0)

``Actor.anim`` is the general manager for anything to do with actor animations.
``Actor.anim.add()`` loads an animation to use with the actor. The string is
the name of the animation to load while the number is the number of seconds
that the animation should play out over. In the example above, playing
the ``"walk_up"`` animation once will take 1.5 seconds where ``"idle"`` will
play out in one second.

Once your animations are loaded in, it's simple to play them::

    def update():
        if keyboard.up:
            alien.y -= 5
            alien.anim.play("walk_up")
        else:
            alien.anim.play("idle")

That's it! The ``actor.anim.play()`` function will start to play the animation
you tell it to. If that animation is already running, it won't do anything.
This is perfect for animations that should run and repeat while the player is
holding down a button for example.

Another way to use an idle animation would be to set it as a base animation.
This animation will always be played whenever other animations you set to play
are finished. We could rewrite the above example as follows::

    alien.anim.set_base("idle")

    def update():
        if keyboard.up:
            alien.y -= 5
            alien.anim.play("walk_up")

Now even though we didn't call ``alien.anim.play("idle")``, the animation will
run whenever no other animation is running. This is very typical for many kinds
of games. Note though that with this approach, the ``"walk_up"`` animation
won't be interrupted when you stop holding the up arrow but will play out
before ``"idle"`` starts playing.

The last big feature of animations are animation queues. With them, you can set
multiple animations to run one after the other until all of them are done::

    alien = Actor("alien", (150, 200), anchor=("center", "bottom"))
    alien.anim.add("stretch", 1.5)
    alien.anim.add("dance", 3.0)
    alien.anim.add("relax", 1.5)
    alien.anim.add_queue("dance_routine", ("stretch", "dance", "relax"))

    def update():
        if keyboard.space:
            alien.anim.play_queue("dance_routine")

As you can see, the animations first have to be added to the ``Actor.anim``
manager normally before you can then add a named animation queue. The first
argument is the name for the queue, the second a tuple or list of the animation
names that should run in that order.

Why not just put all those images in one big animation? Well maybe you'd like
to reuse the ``"dance"`` animation somewhere else. Maybe some other time the
alien should relax first before stretching but shouldn't dance. With queues,
you can use animations individually and grouped up in any combination you want.

With the basics out of the way, let's look at another way to store your
animations in the ``animations`` folder: spritesheets. A spritesheet is a
single image file that holds all the frame images for an entire animation. In
general, a spritesheet can even hold frames of many different animations, but
PGTurbo only supports spritesheets with a single animation on them. Here's an
example of how such a spritesheet file can look like with the individual
frames highlighted:

.. image:: _static/walk_down_frames.png

To use spritesheets to load animations, simply place the spritesheet file
directly into the ``animations`` folder (instead of a subfolder). The name of
the file will be the name of the animation. Then you can load it with the
right function::

    alien = Actor("alien", (150, 200), anchor=("center", "bottom"))
    alien.anim.add_spritesheet("walk_down", 64, 64)

What do these new arguments mean? The two numbers are the width and height of
a single animation frame in the spritesheet. The animation frames will be read
from the file from left to right. After these two numbers, you can give the
duration and other parameters of the animation just like you can do with the
normal ``anim.add()``.

There's many more options like having certain functions run once an animation
or queue is finished and pausing or stopping animations while they run. You can
learn about all of them in the method reference below.

.. method:: anim.add(name, [durations, offsets, callback])

    Adds an animation from a folder with separate image files to the actor's
    animation pool.

    :param name: The name of the folder with the animation frames in it.
    :param durations: Over what time the animation should play out. Default is
                      one second. If given a single number, the animation
                      frames will be evenly distributed over that time. If a
                      list or tuple with a number of values equal to the number
                      of animation frames is given instead, those specific
                      values will be the duration of the respectiv frames.
    :param offsets: How to move the animation frames in relation to the actor's
                    base image. This can be used to properly align animation
                    frames with sizes other than the base image size. Offsets
                    are given as tuples of X and Y changes in relation to the
                    base image topleft corner. For example, if one animation
                    frame is taller than the base image, an offset of (0, -32)
                    would shift it up by 32 pixels.

                    If a single tuple of two numbers is given, that offset is
                    applied to all animation frames. If a tuple or list of
                    multiple offsets is given, each will be applied to only
                    the respective animation frame.
    :param callback: A function name to call once the animation has finished
                     playing.

.. method:: anim.add_spritesheet(name, width, height, [durations, offsets, callback, vertical])

    Adds an animation from a spritesheet to the actor's animation pool.

    :param name: The filename of the spritesheet without a file extension.
    :param width: The width in pixels of an animation frame in the spritesheet.
    :param height: The height in pixels of an animation frame in the sheet.
    :param durations: The duration over which the animation will play. Same
                      possible values and default as for anim.add() above.
    :param offsets: The offsets to be applied to the animation frame whe
                    drawing the actor. Same possible values and default as for
                    anim.add() above.
    :param callback: A function name to call once the animation has finished
                     playing.
    :param vertical: Boolean flag of whether the spritesheet is arranged
                     vertically or not. Default is False, meaning that
                     spritesheets are normally read left to right. If set to
                     True, the spritesheet will be read top to bottom instead.

.. method:: anim.add_queue(name, animation_names, [callback, new_base])

    Adds a new animation queue made up of previously loaded animations.

    :param name: The name for the new animation queue.
    :param animation_names: A tuple or list of the animation names to be
                            included in the queue.
    :param callback: A function name to call once the animation queue has
                     finished playing.
    :param new_base: An animation name that should be set as the new base
                     animation once the queue has finished playing.

.. method:: anim.edit(name, **kwargs):

    Edits the settings of an existing animation. You can edit any of the
    optional parameters of an animation: durations, offsets, sound, callback
    and new_base.

    To change one, simply give that keyword with the new value as an argument
    to edit().

    Example: alien.anim.edit("walk_up", durations=2.0)

    :param name: The name of the animation that should be edited.

.. method:: anim.edit_queue(name, **kwargs):

    Edits the settings of an existing queue. You can edit any of the
    optional parameters of a queue: sound, callback and new_base. Additionaly,
    you can also change what animations the queue plays by giving
    animation_names as a keyword parameter.

    Example: alien.anim.edit_queue("idle", animation_names=("stand", "sit"))

    :param name: The name of the queue that should be edited.

.. method:: anim.set_base(name)

    Set the base animation to play when nothing else is running. If the
    former base animation was running, switch it to the new one.

    :param name: The name of the new base animation. Call with None to remove
                 the base animation.

.. method:: anim.remove(name)

    Removes a loaded animation from the animation pool. If the animation is
    currently playing as part of a queue, the queue will skip forward to the
    next animation in its sequence. If the animation is playing outside of a
    queue, it is stopped before removal. If the animation was on pause, the
    pause state is wiped, meaning unpausing will only play the base animation
    if there is one.

    :param name: The name of the animation to remove.

.. method:: anim.remove_queue(name)

    Removes a named queue from the queue pool. If the queue is currently
    playing, it will be stopped before removal. If the animation was on pause,
    the pause state is wiped, meaning unpausing will only play the base
    animation if there is one.

    :param name: The name of the queue to remove.

.. method:: anim.play(name)

    Play a loaded animation. If the same animation is already running, nothing
    is done. This means you can safely keep calling this without restarting the
    same animation over and over again.

    :param name: The name of the animation to play.

.. method:: anim.play_queue(name, [position])

    Play a named animation queue. If it is already playing, it won't be
    restarted, just like with anim.play().

    :param name: The name of the queue to play.
    :param position: From what animation to start playing the queue. Default is
                     0, which is the first animation. The position numbers
                     reflect zero-indexing.

.. method:: anim.start(name)

    Play a loaded animation. If it is already running, restart the animation.
    This is the important difference to anim.play(). If you want to definitely
    start an animation from the beginning, even if it is already playing, use
    this function.

    :param name: The name of the animation to start playing.

.. method:: anim.start_queue(name, [position])

    Play a named animation queue. If it is already playing, restart it just
    like anim.start().

    :param name: The name of the queue to start playing.
    :param position: From what animation to start playing the queue. Default is
                     0, which is the first animation. The position numbers
                     reflect zero-indexing.

.. method:: anim.pause()

    Pause all animation playback, returning the actor to its static image.

.. method:: anim.unpause()

    Allow all animation playback and return to the state in animation before
    the pause. If something paused was removed, return to playing the base
    animation if there is one. This will also print a warning.

.. method:: anim.stop()

    Stop any currently running animation and return to the base animation if
    one is set.

.. method:: anim.stop_all()

    Stop any currently running animation as well as removing the base
    animation. This returns the display of the actor to the static image.

If you want to query the state of anything to do with animations, you have
access to a number of properties that you can get the value of but can't set
yourself:

.. attribute:: anim.animation_pool

    A tuple of all currently valid animation names.

.. attribute:: anim.queue_pool

    A tuple of all currently valid queue names.

.. attribute:: anim.current

    String name of the currently running animation or None if nothing is
    playing.

.. attribute:: anim.current_queue

    String name of the currently running queue or None if nothing is
    playing or a single animation is running not as part of a queue.

.. attribute:: anim.current_queue_position

    Integer index of which animation in the current queue is running. 0 is the
    first, 1 the second and so on to stay consistent with Python zero-indexing.
    Returns None if no queue is running.

.. attribute:: anim.base_animation

    String name of the currently set base animation or None if no base
    animation is set.

.. attribute:: anim.playing_base

    Boolean of whether the set base animation is currently running.

.. attribute:: anim.paused

    Boolean of whether animations are currently paused.

.. attribute:: anim.current_type

    String for which type of animation is currently playing or None if nothing
    is playing.

    "base" means the base animation is playing, "queue" means a queue is
    playing and "single" means any other animation which is not the base
    animation is playing and not as part of a queue.


Actor ready timers
''''''''''''''''''

.. versionadded:: 1.10

Just like ``clock`` itself, you can also give actors ready timers to keep track
of whether a certain ability or other timer is ready. These are explained in
more detail in the
:ref:`relevant section for the clock builtin <clock_ready_timers>`.

If you want to use them for individual actors, you do so exactly the same way,
just substituting ``clock`` for the variable the actor is in::

    alien = Actor("alien")
    alien.track_ready("jump", 0.8)

    def update():
        if keyboard.space and alien.is_ready("jump")
            alien.vy -= 20
            alien.timeout_ready("jump")

In this case you could have also used the ready timers on ``clock`` itself for
the same effect. Ready timers on actors are useful when there are many actors
of the same type active in your game. For example, if there are 20 aliens all
jumping at different times, each alien having its own timer to see when jump is
available again simplifies your code a lot.


Distance and angle to
'''''''''''''''''''''

.. versionadded:: 1.2

Actors have convenient methods for calculating their distance or angle to other
Actors or ``(x, y)`` coordinate pairs.

.. method:: Actor.distance_to(target)

    Return the distance from this actor's position to target, in pixels.


.. method:: Actor.angle_to(target)

    Return the angle from this actor's position to target, in degrees.

    This will return a number between -180 and 180 degrees. Right is 0 degrees
    and the angles increase going anticlockwise.

    Therefore:

    * Left is 180 degrees.
    * Up is 90 degrees.
    * Down is -90 degrees.


.. _angle_movement:

Angle Movement
''''''''''''''

If an actor is rotated and should move based on its rotation, doing so by
adjusting X and Y coordinates manually can be complicated. To make moving
actors around their rotation easier, Pygame Turbo provides built-in functions.

.. method:: Actor.move_towards_angle(angle, distance)

    Moves the actor the given distance along the given angle.


.. method:: Actor.move_towards_point(point, distance, [overshoot])

    Moves the actor the given distance towards the given point of X and Y.

    By default, if the distance to the point is smaller than the given
    distance, the actor will only move up to the point but not overshoot it.
    If the optional parameter ``overshoot`` is given as True however, the
    actor will move past the target point if the given distance is far enough.


.. method:: Actor.move_forward(distance)

    Moves the actor forwards along its current angle by the given distance.


.. method:: Actor.move_backward(distance)

    Moves the actor backwards in the opposite direction of its current angle
    by the given distance.

.. method:: Actor.move_left(distance)

    Moves the actor sideways to the left when viewing its angle as forward.

    This does not mean the actor moves along the Y-axis, but instead that if
    the actor is pointing to the right, then right is forward to the actor and
    left from its perspective would be up in the game window.

.. method:: Actor.move_right(distance)

    Moves the actor sideways to the right when viewing its angle as forward.

    The same applies here. Right is always in relation to where the actor is
    pointing.

These function could be used to have actors always move towards the player,
circle around a point in a level, get pushed away from something or many other
options. As a small example, let's have the spaceship follow the mouse around
the game window::

    ship = Actor('ship')
    mouse_position = (0, 0)

    def on_mouse_move(pos):
        # To change mouse_position from within a function,
        # we have to declare it global here.
        global mouse_position
        mouse_position = pos

    def update():
        # To just read the value of the global variable,
        # we don't have to do anything else.
        ship.move_towards_point(mouse_position, 5)

*Note:* When using ``move_towards_point()`` with ``overshoot=True``, if the
function is called every frame (for example in ``update()``), the actor will
rapidly jump back and forth since the angle to the target point gets inverted
every frame. To prevent this, use ``move_towards_point()`` without ``overshoot``
or make sure it is not called rapidly with ``overshoot``.


.. _velocity_and_interception:

Velocity and interception
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

In many games, there are lots of things only ever moving along straight lines.
This means they always move with a constant velocity in the X and Y axes, for
which Actors have properties:

* ``.vx`` and ``.vy`` represent the velocity in either axis direction.
* ``.vel`` represents the velocity in both axes as a tuple.

Just like ``.x``, ``.y`` and ``.pos``, these can be read or set individually
or together.

Once an Actor has a velocity, moving them along it is easy.

.. method:: Actor.move_by_vel([scale])

    Moves the Actors position by its velocity once. Calling this every
    ``update()`` will smoothly move the actor along its velocity trajectory.

    If the Actor should be moved at the same angle but different speed, the
    function can be given an optional parameter. ``2.0`` would move twice as
    fast, whereas ``0.1`` would move at 10% of the speed.

Almost as often, we might also want to have an object lead its trajectory
to intercept some other game object which is also moving. There is also a
dedicated function for this.

.. method:: Actor.intercept_velocity(target, speed)

    Returns a velocity tuple that will move from the position of the Actor
    to intercept the target Actor with the given speed, as long as the
    target does not change its velocity at some point.

    The target Actor must have its velocity set for this to work. If no
    valid interception is possible (because the speed is too low), ``None`` is
    returned.

To move an Actor to intercept a target, we can simply set its velocity to the
calculated interception velocity.::

    catcher = Actor("catcher", (40, 20))
    catcher.vel = (3, -1)
    ball = Actor("ball", (10, 10))
    ball.vel = ball.intercept_velocity(catcher, 12.0)

    def update():
        catcher.move_by_vel()
        ball.move_by_vel()

    def draw()
        screen.clear()
        catcher.draw()
        ball.draw()


.. _transparency:

Transparency
''''''''''''

.. versionadded:: 1.3

In some cases it is useful to make an Actor object partially transparent. This
can be used to fade it in or out, or to indicate that it is "disabled".

The ``.opacity`` attribute of an Actor controls how transparent or opaque it
is.

* When an actor is not at all transparent, we say it is "opaque" and it has
  ``opacity`` of ``1.0``, and you can't see through it at all.
* When an actor is completely transparent, it has an ``opacity`` of ``0.0``.
  This will make it completely invisible.

To make an actor that is half-transparent (like a ghost), you could write::

    ghost = Actor('ghost')
    ghost.opacity = 0.5

This diagram shows the scale; the grey checkerboard is used to give the sense
of transparency:

.. image:: _static/opacity.svg
    :alt: The opacity scale in Pygame Turbo.

.. tip::

    The order in which you draw overlapping transparent objects still matters.
    A ghost seen through a window looks slightly different to a window seen
    through a ghost.


.. _simple-shapes:

Simple shapes
'''''''''''''

If you don't have images yet, not to worry! You can start by creating actors
from simple colored shapes like a rectangle or a circle. Instead of calling
``Actor("image_name")`` you instead call
``Actor.Shape(width, height, color)``.

Here's an example::

    character = Actor.Rectangle(100, 100, "red")
    shot = Actor.Ellipse(60, 20, "blue")
    sword = Actor.Triangle(50, 15, "green")

The following shapes can be created this way:

.. method:: Actor.Rectangle(width, height, color)

    Creates an actor with a filled rectangle of the given color as its
    image. To create a perfect square, simply give the same value for both
    width and height.

.. method:: Actor.Ellipse(width, height, color)

    Creates an actor with a filled circular shape of the given color as its
    image. The background of the image is transparent. To create a perfect
    circle, simply give the same value for both width and height.

.. method:: Actor.Triangle(width, height, color)

    Creates an actor with a filled triangle of the given color as its image.
    The triangle points to the right so it always points in the direction of
    the ``angle`` of the actor.

If you wanted to define other parameters like anchor or position when creating
the actors, you can still do so just like with a normal Actor construction::

    balloon = Actor.Ellipse(50, 50, "red", (150, 150), anchor=("center", "bottom"))

On screen or not
''''''''''''''''

There is a simple function to check whether an Actor is visible on the screen:

.. method:: Actor.is_onscreen()

    Returns ``True`` if the Actor is currently inside the screen bounds and
    ``False`` if not.

This can be useful if you have many game objects flying around the screen that
should disappear as soon as they are out of sight.


The Keyboard
------------

You probably noticed that we used the ``keyboard`` in the above code.
If you'd like to know what keys are pressed on the keyboard, you can query the
attributes of the ``keyboard`` builtin. If, say, the left arrow is held down,
then ``keyboard.left`` will be ``True``, otherwise it will be ``False``.

There are attributes for every key; some examples::

    keyboard.a  # The 'A' key
    keyboard.left  # The left arrow key
    keyboard.rshift  # The right shift key
    keyboard.kp0  # The '0' key on the keypad
    keyboard.k_0  # The main '0' key

The full set of key constants is given in the `Buttons and Keys`_
documentation, but the attributes are lowercase, because these are variables
not constants.

.. deprecated:: 1.1

    Uppercase and prefixed attribute names (eg. ``keyboard.LEFT`` or
    ``keyboard.K_a``) are now deprecated; use lowercase attribute names
    instead.

.. _`Buttons and Keys`: hooks.html#buttons-and-keys

.. versionadded:: 1.1

    You can now also query the state of the keys using the keyboard constants
    themselves::

        keyboard[keys.A]  # True if the 'A' key is pressed
        keyboard[keys.SPACE]  # True if the space bar is pressed


Animations
----------

You can animate most things in pygame using the builtin ``animate()``. For
example, to move an :ref:`Actor <actor>` from its current position on the
screen to the position ``(100, 100)``::

    animate(alien, pos=(100, 100))

.. function:: animate(object, tween='linear', duration=1, on_finished=None, **targets)

    Animate the attributes on object from their current value to that
    specified in the targets keywords.

    :param tween: The type of *tweening* to use.
    :param duration: The duration of the animation, in seconds.
    :param on_finished: Function called when the animation finishes.
    :param targets: The target values for the attributes to animate.

The tween argument can be one of the following:

+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| 'linear'           | Animate at a constant speed from start to finish     | .. image:: images/linear.png           |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| 'accelerate'       | Start slower and accelerate to finish                | .. image:: images/accelerate.png       |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| 'decelerate'       | Start fast and decelerate to finish                  | .. image:: images/decelerate.png       |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| 'accel_decel'      | Accelerate to mid point and decelerate to finish     | .. image:: images/accel_decel.png      |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| 'in_elastic'       | Give a little wobble at the end                      | .. image:: images/in_elastic.png       |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| 'out_elastic'      | Have a little wobble at the start                    | .. image:: images/out_elastic.png      |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| 'in_out_elastic'   | Have a wobble at both ends                           | .. image:: images/in_out_elastic.png   |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| 'bounce_end'       | Accelerate to the finish and bounce there            | .. image:: images/bounce_end.png       |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| 'bounce_start'     | Bounce at the start                                  | .. image:: images/bounce_start.png     |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| 'bounce_start_end' | Bounce at both ends                                  | .. image:: images/bounce_start_end.png |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+

The ``animate()`` function returns an ``Animation`` instance:

.. class:: Animation

    .. method:: stop(complete=False)

        Stop the animation, optionally completing the transition to the final
        property values.

        :param complete: Set the animated attribute to the target value.

    .. attribute:: running

        This will be True if the animation is running. It will be False
        when the duration has run or the ``stop()`` method was called before
        then.

    .. attribute:: on_finished

        You may set this attribute to a function which will be called
        when the animation duration runs out. The ``on_finished`` argument
        to ``animate()`` also sets this attribute. It is not called when
        ``stop()`` is called. This function takes no arguments.


Tone Generator
--------------

.. versionadded:: 1.2

Pygame Turbo can play tones using a built-in synthesizer.

.. function:: tone.play(pitch, duration)

    Play a note at the given pitch for the given duration.

    Duration is in seconds.

    The `pitch` can be specified as a number in which case it is the frequency
    of the note in hertz.

    Alternatively, the pitch can be specified as a string representing a note
    name and octave. For example:

    * ``'E4'`` would be E in octave 4.
    * ``'A#5'`` would be A-sharp in octave 5.
    * ``'Bb3'`` would be B-flat in octave 3.

Creating notes, particularly long notes, takes time - up to several
milliseconds. You can create your notes ahead of time so that this doesn't slow
your game down while it is running:

.. function:: tone.create(pitch, duration)

    Create and return a Sound object.

    The arguments are as for play(), above.

This could be used in a Pygame Turbo program like this::

    beep = tone.create('A3', 0.5)

    def on_mouse_down():
        beep.play()


.. _data-storage:

Data Storage
------------

The ``storage`` object behaves just like a Python dictionary but its contents
are preserved across game sessions. The values you assign to storage will be
saved as JSON_, which means you can only store certain types of objects in it:
``list``/``tuple``, ``dict``, ``str``, ``float``/``int``, ``bool``, and
``None``.

.. _JSON: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON

The ``storage`` for a game is initially empty. Your code will need to handle
the case that values are loaded as well as the case that no values are found.

A tip is to use ``setdefault()``, which inserts a default if there is no value
for the key, but does nothing if there is.

For example, we could write::

    storage.setdefault('highscore', 0)

After this line is executed, ``storage['highscore']`` will contain a value -
``0`` if there was no value loaded, or the loaded value otherwise. You could
add all of your ``setdefault`` lines towards the top of your game, before
anything else looks at ``storage``::

    storage.setdefault('level', 1)
    storage.setdefault('player_name', 'Anonymous')
    storage.setdefault('inventory', [])

Now, during gameplay we can update some values::

    if player.colliderect(mushroom):
        score += 5
        if score > storage['highscore']:
            storage['highscore'] = score

You can read them back at any time::

    def draw():
        ...
        screen.draw.text('Highscore: ' + storage['highscore'], ...)

...and of course, they'll be preserved when the game next launches.

These are some of the most useful methods of ``storage``:

.. class:: Storage(dict)

    .. method:: storage[key] = value

        Set a value in the storage.

    .. method:: storage[key]

        Get a value from the storage. Raise KeyError if there is no such key
        in the storage.

    .. method:: setdefault(key, default)

        Insert a default value into the storage, only if no value already
        exists for this key.

    .. method:: get(key, default=None)

        Get a value from the storage. If there is no such key, return default,
        or None if no default was given.

    .. method:: clear()

        Remove all stored values. Use this if you get into a bad state.

    .. method:: save()

        Saves the data to disk now. You don't usually need to call this, unless
        you're planning on using ``load()`` to reload a checkpoint, for
        example.

    .. method:: load()

        Reload the contents of the storage with data from the save file. This
        will replace any existing data in the storage.

    .. attribute:: path

        The actual path to which the save data will be written.


.. caution::

    As you make changes to your game, ``storage`` could contain values that
    don't work with your current code. You can either check for this, or call
    ``.clear()`` to remove all old values, or delete the save game file.


.. tip::

    Remember to check that your game still works if the storage is empty!
